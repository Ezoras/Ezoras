Hi, I'm Eren. I'm 18 years old. I'm from Izmir. I have one sister who is six years older than me. I have graduated from Izmir Ataturk Highschool and currently studying at Bilkent University as a freshman. My major is Computer Science. I like reading mangas, playing map staring games and walking aimlessly.
